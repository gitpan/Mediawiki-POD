  * rewrite the plugin code to use pipes instead of the commandline,
    this makes it work with inputs of any size. Unfortunately, it
    generates a hard dependency on PHP 4 (or PHP 5, depending). Ugh.
  * we need to replace newlines inside <pre> sections with <br>
  * hopefully fix the failing tests due to Pod::Simple::HTML missing
  * create a subclass of Pod::Simple::HTML, this makes it possible
    to create a table of contents (collapsable with JS)
  * clean up some of the generated HTML of unwanted junk
